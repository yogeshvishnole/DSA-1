1. What is algorithm ?
A step by step method to solve a problem is called an algorithm.

Example - Problem Statment -> Make tea.
So algorithm for making tea.
Step 1. Hot water.
Step 2. Mix Milk
Step 3 Add sugar.
Step 4 Add Elaichi.
Step 5 boil for 5 minute.
STep 6 Drink tea.

2. How to Approach a problem ?
Step 1 -> Understand the problem statement.
Step 2 -> Write down the inputs.
Step 3 -> Create Logic / Algorithm to solve the problem.

Example sum 100 and 200.

Step 1 we need to add 100 and 200.
Step 2 input for problem are two number 100 and 200 that we need to add.
Step 3 a = 100
b = 200
o/p c =a+b = 100+200 = 300

EXample2 Distance = 20KM Time = 2hour what is speed ?
Step 1 We need to find of bike.
STep2 Inputs d = 20km t = 2hour
Step 3 speed = d/t = 20/2 = 10km/h

Flowchart and Pseudocode - 

Pseudocode - 
Pseudo code and flowchart are ways to express solutions of a problem in front  of others and to dry run the rogh solutions to check their correctness.
Pseudo code is a english rough solution of a problem on paper.

Flowchart -

Flowchart is a diagrammatic way to explain solution of a problem.
Flowchart contains various symbols for different things.
You can find symbols of flowchart on internet.

Using a computer to solve a problem ?
Take example of a problem to find if a no. n is prime or not.
so lets say n = 17 how we can find if it is prime or not.
We divide it by 2 to ...n-1 to 16 but if no, is 1000017
then we have to divide it how many time from 2 to 1000016.
which not possible for human thats why computer we can give it a 
logic then it will repeat it very fast as compare to human.

compiler converts HLL to LLL(machine code)

problem -> solution -> pseudocode -> c++(HLL) -> compiler --> Machine code.
