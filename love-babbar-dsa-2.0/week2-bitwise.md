We learn the following topics -
1. Bitwise operartors -
1. AND -> &
2. OR ->  |
3. NOT -> ~
4. XOR -> ^

See there truth tables.

Then we learn 
Left Shift -> <<  mulitply by 2
Right Shift -> >> divide by 2

Then we learn --> Increment and decrement operators.
Then break and continue statement.
Then typecasting -> implicit and explicit
Then Switch-case statement

Then functions -> declartion, definition and function call stack
