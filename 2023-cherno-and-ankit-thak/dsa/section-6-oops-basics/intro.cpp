/*

OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System
OOPs is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects
Objects and Classes are the two main aspects of OOPs.
Objects are the instances of classes, which can be used to represent data and behavior of real-world entities.
Classes are the user-defined data types, which can be used to create objects.
Classes are the blueprints of objects.
Classes can have data members (variables) and member functions (methods).
Data members represent the state of the object, and member functions represent the behavior of the object.
