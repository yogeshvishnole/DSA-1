## There are 6 problems which are similar to knapsack that are

1. Subset sum problem
2. Equal sum partition
3. Count of subset sum
4. Minimum subset sum difference
5. Target sum
6. Number of subsets with given difference

### Now how to identify that the given problem of DP is same as kanpsack

1. We have given an array of some items, knapsack also has array of items the two arrays wt[] and val[] are just same properties of item array,so there can be 1 array.
2. One capacity will be given.
3. We have to find the optimum value either maximum or minimum.
