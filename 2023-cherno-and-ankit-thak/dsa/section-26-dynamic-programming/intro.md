DP - Dynamic Programming

DP problems can be solved in two ways

1. Tabular approach - Top down DP
2. Recursive approach - Bottom up approach

Always start learning with bottom up approach as it is quite inituitive.

How to identify DP problems?

1. Choice is given
2. Optimality is asked for instance maximum of something or minimum of something
3. Problems of recursion with 2 overlapping subproblems will mostly use DP

DP has lot of parent problems if you do them you will understand a lot of question in one go.
Below 10 parent problems are equivalent to 80 problems

1. 0-1 Knapsack (6 child problems)
2. Unbound knapsack (5)
3. Fibonacci (7)
4. LCS (15)
5. LIS (10)
6. Kadane's algorithm (6)
7. Matrix chain multiplication (7)
8. DP on trees (4)
9. DP on grid (14)
10. others (5)
