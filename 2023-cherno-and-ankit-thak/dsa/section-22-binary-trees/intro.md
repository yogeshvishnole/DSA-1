<!--
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is widely used in computer science for organizing data, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Key Properties of a Binary Tree:

Root: The topmost node of the tree.
Node: Each element in the tree. A node contains:
Data/Value: The information stored in the node.
Left Child: A reference to another binary tree, which represents the left subtree.
Right Child: A reference to another binary tree, which represents the right subtree.
Leaf Nodes: Nodes with no children (both left and right children are null or None).
Height: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
Depth: The distance of a node from the root.

Types of Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: The height of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by at most one.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent node, and the right child is greater than the parent node.

Applications:
Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient searching and sorting.
Expression Trees in compilers.
Heaps for priority queues.
Huffman Trees in data compression algorithms.
