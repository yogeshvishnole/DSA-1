1. In a directed graph if you dont care about the indegree edges coming inside then create a
   single normal adjacency list,otherwise create two lists one for forward edges and another for backward edges, see p9-reporder-routes.

Patterns -

1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Storing parents in BFS and DFS to detect cycles
4. Multisource BFS - very imp to understand.
5. matrix as graphs.
6. connected components
