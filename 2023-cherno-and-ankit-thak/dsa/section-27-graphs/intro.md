##Graphs

Why Graph data structure ?

We have already learn a lot of data structures such as -
1. Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queues
5. Heaps
6. Trees
We see that each data structures solve specific use cases that are derived from their
structures. Like arrays provide good random access, stacks provide LIFO, Queues provide FIFO, heaps provide priority based queues, Trees provide one way data flows.
Graph is a raw data structure in which data nodes can be connected to each other in any
direction, this property of graph make it complex to implement but also make it very versatile data structure, its application encompasses the following areas -
1. Social networking applications
2. Google Maps/ Apple Maps
3. File Systems (Trees can also be used)

We are going to learn graphs into following 14 chapters, in each chapter we will solve 3 to 4 problems, so we will solve around 50 questions in this series.

## 15 Chapters

   a. Breadth first search.
   b. Depth first search.
