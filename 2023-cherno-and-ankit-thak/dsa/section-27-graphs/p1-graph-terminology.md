In the graph data structure, there are several key terminologies you should be familiar with. Here's a breakdown:

1. Basic Terminology:

   1. Graph (G): A collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges. Usually represented as G = (V, E) where:
      - V = set of vertices (nodes)
      - E = set of edges (connections between nodes)
   2. Vertex (Node): A fundamental unit or point in a graph. Denoted as v ∈ V.
   3. Edge (Link): A connection or line between two vertices. Denoted as e ∈ E.
   4. Adjacent / Neighbor: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected directly by an edge.
   5. Degree: The number of edges incident (connected) to a vertex.
   6. In-degree: For directed graphs, the number of incoming edges.
   7. Out-degree: For directed graphs, the number of outgoing edges.
   8. Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where edges have a direction (e.g., from A to B).
   9. Undirected Graph: A graph where edges have no direction (e.g., A is connected to B and vice versa).
   10. Weighted Graph: A graph where edges carry a weight (e.g., cost, distance).
   11. Unweighted Graph: A graph where all edges are treated equally (no weights).

2. Graph Types:

   1. Simple Graph: A graph with no loops (edges connecting a node to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
   2. Multigraph: A graph that allows multiple edges (parallel edges) between the same pair of vertices.
   3. Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle (a path where the first and last vertices are the same).
   4. Acyclic Graph: A graph that contains no cycles.
   5. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): A directed graph with no cycles.
   6. Connected Graph: An undirected graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.
   7. Disconnected Graph: A graph that has at least one pair of vertices with no path between them.
   8. Complete Graph: A graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

3. Path and Traversal:

   1. Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices.
   2. Simple Path: A path that does not revisit any vertex.
   3. Cycle: A path where the starting and ending vertices are the same.
   4. Tree: A special kind of acyclic, connected graph.
   5. Spanning Tree: A subgraph that includes all vertices and is a tree.
   6. Subgraph: A graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of another graph.
   7. Traversal: Visiting all the nodes in a graph.
      - Common algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search).

4. Advanced Terms:
   1. Topological Sort: Linear ordering of vertices in a DAG such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v.
   2. Strongly Connected Components (SCC): In a directed graph, a maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in that subgraph.
