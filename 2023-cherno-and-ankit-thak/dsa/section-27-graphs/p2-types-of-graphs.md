There are ot of types of Graphs, Here we will see mainly four types.

On the Basis of edges

1. Directed Graphs - Edges have direction lets say there are two vertexs A and B and A is connected to B with an edge whose arrow is pointing at B then we will say A is connected B. If arrow is pointing at A then we will
   say B is connected to A.

2. Undirected Graphs - Edgesare not directed, such graphs are also called bidirectional

On the Basis of edges

3. Weighted Graphs - Edges have weights like 5,10 etc, they can represent any property like distance if is representing a road, hours if it is representing the time.

4. Unweighted Graphs - Edges does not carry any weight.

Some other types -

5. Complete Graph - Every node of graph is connected to every other node of the graph.

6. Disconnected Graph - A Disconnected Graph is a type of graph in which there is at least one pair of vertices that do not have a path connecting them. In other words, not all vertices in the graph are reachable from each other. This is in contrast to a Connected Graph, where there is a path between every pair of vertices.

7. A Connected Graph is a type of graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. This means that all vertices in the graph are reachable from each other. In a connected graph, there are no isolated vertices or disconnected subgraphs. This is in contrast to a Disconnected Graph, where at least one pair of vertices does not have a path connecting them.

8. Cyclic Graph - Graph containing a cycle or having a closed loop then it is called a cyclic graph.

9. Acyclic graph - Graph which does not form closed loop or not have cycles are called acyclic graphs.

10. Euler Graph - An Euler Graph (or Eulerian Graph) is a graph in which there exists a closed trail (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex) that visits every edge exactly once. This closed trail is known as an Eulerian Circuit. For a graph to be Eulerian, it must satisfy the following conditions:

All vertices with non-zero degree are connected.
a. Every vertex has an even degree.
b. If a graph has an Eulerian Circuit, it is called an Eulerian Graph.

11. Hamiltonian Graph -
    A Hamiltonian Graph is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. In other words, a Hamiltonian cycle is a closed loop on a graph where every node (vertex) is visited exactly once.

For a graph to be Hamiltonian, it must satisfy the following condition:

There exists a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.
Unlike Eulerian graphs, there are no simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian. However, there are some sufficient conditions, such as Dirac's theorem and Ore's theorem, which provide criteria under which a graph is guaranteed to be Hamiltonian.
