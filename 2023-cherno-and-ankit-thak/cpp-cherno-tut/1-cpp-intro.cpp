1. why cpp , cpp is close to hardware that makes it fast , it is older and so pervasive all over that
make it very famous.

2. Lets briefly see how cpp works -
  a. we write a program in cpp
  b. we install a compiler for particulat platform (OS windows,linux,android) and particular architecture(intel 32 bit , m1 etc)
  c. compiler will convert the cpp code into native machine code for that platform and architecture.
  d. Now how C# and java works , there code is first compiled into an intermedite code which runs on vm (jvm etc)
  e. vm code runs on a platform like german person (computer) reading a book in english (java / c sharp code) with the help of a translator person (vm) 
  f. cpp code can also be slow if it is not properly written or bad code.
  g. in such case (bad code) cpp code will be slower than the vm lang code as vm languages makes a lot of optimizations that cpp
  not do.
