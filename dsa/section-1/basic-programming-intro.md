Computer does not understand human language.
Computer understands binary.
We will give our program (instructions) to computer in a high level language (a english type language.)
Compile a software that converts a HLL progrram into low level language program (assembly or binary).
COmpiler also caught syntax errors and other compile time issues.

Logical errors are runtime errors.

Integrated Development Environment.

I will use vscode with cmake as builde system and GCC as compiler + linker and windows OS + intel CPU will be 
our executer.
