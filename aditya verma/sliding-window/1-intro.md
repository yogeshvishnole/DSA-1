### What will be covered in the video

1. Origin of sliding window
2. Brute force method to solve sliding window problems
3. Identify - how to indentify the sliding window problems
4. Types of sliding window problems

### Origin

Inituition is very clear, try solving a problem using this technique and you will find that a window of contagious elements in an linear data structure (example array and string) slides over time.

### Brute force

loop inside loop - O(n2)

### Sliding window -

m is the input and n is size of window
O(m+n)

### Identify

Problems should contain following -

1. A linear data structure - array or string.
2. Problem should mention to find sub array or sub set of something and that subset should be contagios.
3. a window size (sub array size) should be given or the solver need to find the window size.
4. the solver should find the max,min or sum etc of the window.

### Types of sliding window problems

1. Fixed window problems

In this problems window size is given, the solver need to find the max,min or sum amongst the window elements.

2. Variable window problems

In this problems the solver need to find the window size, and the max,min or sum etc of window elements is also given to solve the problem

nOne way to solve sliding window problems is by your general logic
And one way is to follow a pattern which will be used in all problems

Recommendation -
Here I will solve problems by both ways, but I you will practised the pattern, you do not hve to think about the code
in the challenges and this is a plus point go with the pattern.
